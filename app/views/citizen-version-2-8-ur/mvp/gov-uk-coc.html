        <p class="govuk-body"> Your Pension Credit might be stopped or reduced if you do not report a change straight away. Some changes will increase the amount of Pension Credit you could get.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body"> Changes that you need to report include:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>starting or stopping <a href="#partner">living with a partner</a></li>
    <li>the death of a partner who is named on your claim</li>
    <li>starting or stopping work</li>
    <li>going into hospital or a care home</li>
    <li>people moving in or out of your home</li>
    <li>moving home</li>
    <li>changing your name</li>
    <li>switching your bank account</li>

    <li>leaving England, Scotland and Wales for any period of time</li>
    <li>you start or stop looking after a child or young person under the age of 20</li>
  </ul>




  <p class="govuk-body">You also need to report if your income or expenses change. This can include changes to:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>housing costs, for example ground rent or service charges</li>
    <li>benefits that anyone living in your home gets - including getting a new benefit or a benefit being stopped</li>
    <li>occupational or personal pensions - including if you start to get a new pension or take a lump sum out of your pension pot</li>
    <li>other income, for example foreign pensions or Working Tax Credits</li>
    <li>savings, investments or property</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"><a name="partner">If you live with a partner</a> who is under State Pension age</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">If you were already getting Pension Credit for yourself and your partner before 15 May 2019 when the rules for couples changed, you’ll continue to get it even if your partner is still under State Pension age. </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">If your Pension Credit stops for any reason, you usually cannot get it again until your partner reaches State Pension age. But you might if you or your partner are getting Housing Benefit for people over State Pension age both:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>when your Pension Credit stopped</li>
  <li>when you want to start claiming it again</li>
</ul>
  <p class=govuk-body>If you cannot get Pension Credit, you might be entitled to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit">Universal Credit</a>.</p>
  <div class="govuk-inset-text">You cannot get Universal Credit and Pension Credit at the same time. If you are getting Pension Credit and you or your partner start getting Universal Credit your entitlement to Pension Credit will stop.</div>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If you start living with a partner who is under State Pension age </h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">You will stop getting Pension Credit if you start living with a partner who is under State Pension age. You can apply for it again when your partner reaches State Pension age.</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l  id="changes-to-assessed-income-periods-aips">Assessed Income Periods (<abbr title="Assessed Income Periods">AIPs</abbr>)</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body"> An <abbr title="Assessed Income Period">AIP</abbr> is a period of time when you do not have to report changes to your pensions, savings or investments. Your Pension Credit award letter tells you if you have one.</p>

  <div class="govuk-inset-text">However, if you have an <abbr title="Assessed Income Period">AIP</abbr> with no end date you must still report changes to your personal circumstances, for example if you move into a care home.
  </div>

  <p class="govuk-body"> No new <abbr title="Assessed Income Periods">AIPs</abbr> have been set since April 2016 and if your AIP comes to an end due to your personal circumstances, it will not be renewed. You will need to report any changes to your circumstances when it ends. Read about the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pension-credit">changes to <abbr title="Assessed Income Periods">AIPs</abbr> including the new end dates</a>.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body"> Call the Pension Credit helpline if you’re not sure if you need to report a change.</p>
