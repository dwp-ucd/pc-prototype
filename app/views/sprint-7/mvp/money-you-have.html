      <p class="govuk-body">@pete this needs to be a nice oveview, agents are using this as a prompt to start taking down data. So maybe not a list? I'll leave in the list so you have context. This includes:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Money in the UK and aboard</li>
        <li>money in current, saving or deposit accounts</li>
        <li>money invested in ISAs, shares or unit trusts</li>
        <li>capital bonds, premium bonds</li>
        <li>any other National Savings and Investment products</li>
        <li>property or Land other than your home</li>
        <li>any other money held in this country or abroad</li>
        <li>sums of money you keep at home in cash</li>
        <li>lump sums, such as insurance payouts, that you expect in the near future</li>
      </ul>
