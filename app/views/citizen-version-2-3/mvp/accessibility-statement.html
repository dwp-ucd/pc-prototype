          change colours, contrast levels and fonts
        </li>
        <li>
          zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen

        How accessible this service is
      </h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The service is using common styles, patterns and components from the

      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          at one point we ask you to list your conditions using a JavaScript
          solution that allows you to keep adding additional fields. This can be
          tricky. However, with JavaScript turned off the service will default
          to a large amount of blank fields which some people might find easier to
          fill out.
        </li>
      </ul>
